📌 Project Title

Autonomous Vehicle Safety Analysis using nuScenes Dataset (TTC, Distance & Collision Risk Prediction)

📍 Overview

This project analyzes real-world driving scenes from the NuScenes autonomous driving dataset to detect potential collision risks.
It computes critical safety parameters such as:

Ego vehicle speed

Ego acceleration

Minimum distance to surrounding vehicles

Distance to pedestrian

Time-To-Collision (TTC)

Combined Safety Risk Score

The system then ranks the most dangerous moments, plots risk variations over time, and helps identify when braking/avoidance is required.

🔥 Key Outcomes
     Metric	                     Meaning	                     Why it matters
Distance to objects  	How close ego car is to others  	Indicates risk & safe spacing
TTC	                  Time left before collision	      Lower = dangerous event likely
Risk Score	          Combined risk indicator	          Helps decision making
Critical Frames	      Most dangerous timestamps	        For emergency interventions

🚗 Results Snapshot

Example detected high-risk frame:

Time = 2.05 sec
Min Distance = 2.56 m
TTC = 0.34 sec
Risk Score = 1.920 (CRITICAL)


📊 Final output includes:

Risk score graph over time

Speed & acceleration pattern

Distance curve to vehicles & pedestrians

TTC critical points
