📌 Project Title

Autonomous Vehicle Safety Analysis using nuScenes Dataset (TTC, Distance & Collision Risk Prediction)

📍 Overview

This project analyzes real-world driving scenes from the NuScenes autonomous driving dataset to detect potential collision risks.
It computes critical safety parameters such as:

Ego vehicle speed

Ego acceleration

Minimum distance to surrounding vehicles

Distance to pedestrian

Time-To-Collision (TTC)

Combined Safety Risk Score

The system then ranks the most dangerous moments, plots risk variations over time, and helps identify when braking/avoidance is required.

🚗 Results Snapshot

Example detected high-risk frame:

Time = 2.05 sec
Min Distance = 2.56 m
TTC = 0.34 sec
Risk Score = 1.920 (CRITICAL)


📊 Final output includes:

Risk score graph over time

Speed & acceleration pattern

Distance curve to vehicles & pedestrians

TTC critical points

Top 5 dangerous scenes ranking
